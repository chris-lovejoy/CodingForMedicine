    "# Predicting Strokes from Admission Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this exercise we are going to try to predict strokes from admission data using various machine learning models**\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise uses a [stroke dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "Like other exercises, this is a **classification problem** - where we will try to determine if people have a stroke or not from some commonly used clinical metrics. We will also learn about the problem of **_class imbalance_**: a particularly common issue in healthcare - and learn about some approaches to over coming it. Furthermore, we will learn how to **use data pipelines**: an approach that helps us clean and and transform our data into a form which is more effective for machine learning algorithms to interpret and learn with.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we'll learn how to:\n",
    "- **Download data** and **load it into our Jupyter Notebook**\n",
    "- Import useful libraries like **pandas**, **sci-kit learn**, and **imbalanced-learn**\n",
    "- **Clean our data**, and **modify it with sci-kit learn pipelines**\n",
    "- Explore how we can manage **class imbalance**\n",
    "- Quantify our model with **various metrics**"

For example, if we look at our BMI data, we can see that the range of values is quite wide: the lowest value is 10.3 - where the largest is 97.6! However the majority of values lie between 20 and 40; this large can trip up some algorithms. \n",

    "An unbalanced dataset is where a *class* or outcome is much less common than another: in this case the vast majority of people don't have strokes. This can lead machine learning models to tend to predict a common class (`no stroke`) over a minority/rare class (`stroke`) as it has receives many more examples of one class over another, and is unable to learn what differentiates the two.\n",

    "There are various ways of approaching unbalanced datasets like these, which we will explore now:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get More Data\n",

    "\n",
    "### Weighting/Model Penalization\n",
    "We can 'penalize' our model to put a greater weighting on a minority class. In essence, this forces the model to pay more attention to the minority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resampling\n",
    "Essentially we are manipulating our dataset so there is a ratio of classes closer to 50:50. There are two approaches within this:\n",
    " 1. **Undersampling** - where we take a sample (either randomly, or through more intelligent means) of the **majority** class, so that the ratio is limited, or\n",
    " 2. **Oversampling** - where we expand the number of **minority** class: we can do this by duplicating instances of the minority class, or we can synthesise examples of this class.\n",
