    "We mentioned before that all data types in Python are objects, think of the methods as being part of those objects.\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to understand methods we should define some terms. To pass this information to a method, we assign values to a **parameter** of the method. The assigned values are called **arguments**. The act of using a method on a data type is called a **method invocation** or calling a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you want to insert a list item into a list. We need to specify what the list item is and where in the list to put it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The list `insert()` method has two required parameters `pos` and `element`. The syntax looks like this `list.insert(pos,element)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "So valid syntax for this method might be `list.insert(1,\"Data Science\")`. The arguments are `1` and `Data Science`. Here we are assigning the parameter `pos` with the value `1` and assigning the parameter `elemnet` with `Data Science`. So the value `Data Science` will be inserted in the first position of the list\n",
