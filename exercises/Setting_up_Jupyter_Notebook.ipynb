    "# Testing our environmental setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to introduce Jupyter Notebooks and for testing the environmental setup (whether running on Google Colab or on your local computer).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook is a browser-based tool for executing code, with an emphasis on easy visualisation and interpretability. It is most commonly used for Python, although can be used for other languages such as Julia, R, Haskell and Ruby. The file extension for Jupyter Notebook files are usually '.ipynb'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to run a Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "You can either run Jupyter Notebooks on [Google Colaboratory](http://colab.research.google.com/) (\"Google Colab\") or on your local computer. Google Colaboratory is quicker and easier to set-up. It saves you downloading the Jupyter software, as well as associated libraries (e.g. numpy, pandas) that you may need.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But there are advantages to running Jupyter on your local computer, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **You can manage data files more easily.** In Google Colab, you may have to re-upload data files each time you re-load the notebook. This isn't ture when the files are local.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Version control is easier**, for example by uploading different versions of your notebook to [GitHub](https://www.github.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **You can import your own modules more easily.** Once you are more experienced with Jupyter Notebooks, you may want to import custom Python scripts into your notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to get setup\n",
    "If you want to run the Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab, click on the 'Open in Colab' button at the top of this notebook. Then, click \"File -> Save a copy in Drive\". You must be logged into a Google account to do so. This will make a local copy of the notebook within your Google Drive which you can then modify.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to run the Jupyter Notebook locally, use [this guide](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/) to get up and running.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing local packages\n",
    "If you are running Jupyter Notebook locally, you may need to install 'packages' or 'libraries'. These are pieces of code that enable specific functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "Popular Python packages include:\n",
    "- **numpy**: For more advanced manipulation of numbers\n",
    "- **pandas**: For better handling of data\n",
    "- **matplotlib**: For visualisation of data, with plots and graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to install these for use in a Jupyter Notebook is with the 'conda' package manager. This involves running\n",
    "> 'conda install [package-name]' \n",
    "\n",
    "from the command line/terminal. The commands for different packages can be found on the Anaconda website, such as [this command for installing numpy](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/numpy).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing your setup\n",
    "As a general principle, a completed Jupyter Notebook should be able to run through to completion. You can test by selecting \"Kernel -> Restart and Run All\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps prevent mistakes that can cause erroneous outputs. For example, one common mistake is using a variable that is declared later on in the notebook or accidentally declaring two variables with the same name. This may not be obvious while writing the initial code, because the variable will be stored in memory. But when you restart and run from front-to-back, the notebook will throw an error.\n"
